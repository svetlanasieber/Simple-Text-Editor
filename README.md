# Simple-Text-Editor

You are given an empty text. Your task is to implement 4 types of commands related to manipulating the text:
# •	"1 {string}" - appends [string] to the end of the text.
# •	"2 {count}" - erases the last [count] elements from the text.
# •	"3 {index}" - returns the element at position [index] from the text.
# •	"4" - undoes the last not-undone command of type 1 or 2 and returns the text to the state before that operation.

# Input
# •	The first line contains N, the number of operations, where 1 ≤ N ≤ 105.
# •	Each of the following N lines contains the name of the operation, followed by the command argument, if any, separated by space in the following format "command argument". 
# •	The length of the text will not exceed 1000000.
# •	All input characters are English letters.
# •	It is guaranteed that the sequence of input operations is possible to perform.

# Output
# •	For each operation of type "3" print a single line with the returned character of that operation
